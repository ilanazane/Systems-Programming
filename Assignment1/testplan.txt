Case E (Done 100 times):
    Calls malloc(60), uses the returned pointer to insert a ~60 char string into the myblock array, 
        and then immediately frees the pointer.
    This is done 50 times for each iteration of the test case.

Case F (Done 100 times):
    Calls malloc(60) and uses the returned pointer to insert a ~60 char string into the myblock array.
        This is done 50 times to fill up almost the entirety of the array with data.
    Then, the fifty 60 byte strings are freed one by one.



Reason these test cases were chosen:
    None of the given test cases actually put any data into the static myblock array, 
        so we thought that these test cases could give a more accurate simulation of main memory.
